 * MapComponentsProvider must be imported and wrapped around component where at least one of its child nodes requires access to a MapLibre-gl or openlayers instance that is registered in this mapContext.
MapComponentsProvider must be used one level higher than the first use of MapContext.
 *
 * MapComponentsProvider requires at least one use of the MapLibreMap component somewhere down the component tree that will create the MapLibre-gl object and set the reference at MapContext.map. For MapLibre maps it is a good idea to provide a mapId attribute to the MapLibreMap Component even if you are only using a single map instance at start. It will make a later transition to using multiple instances within the same project much easier.
